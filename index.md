## Frida Allsafe Application

Hello 😄! This repository will serve as documentation of my progress learning Frida for my Master Thesis.

I do not expect that somebody find this however if you find this guide 
i hope it can help you in some manner 😊.

### What is Frida? ⚔️

It’s Greasemonkey for native apps, or, put in more technical terms, it’s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. 
It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX.
Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API.

### What is Allsafe? 🏳
Allsafe is an intentionally vulnerable application that contains various vulnerabilities. Unlike other vulnerable Android apps, this one is less like a CTF and more like a real-life application that uses modern libraries and technologies.

### Tools used 📱

- Rooted Phone (Samsung A40)
- Frida
- ADB
